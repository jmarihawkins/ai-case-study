# Disrupting the Status Quo: Simply Homes uses AI to Impact the Affordable Housing Landscape

## Overview and Origin

In the vast landscape of the modern world, the term "home" represents far more than just brick and mortar; it embodies security, comfort, and belonging. Yet, for many individuals and families worldwide, the dream of having a place to call their own remains elusive amidst the labyrinth of the housing crisis. This crisis, a confluence of economic challenges, urbanization, and socio-political complexities, has cast a shadow over countless lives, leaving them grappling with the uncertainty of shelter and stability. Against this backdrop of uncertainty and despair, a beacon of hope emerges in the form of Simply Homes.

Founded on December 14, 2020, by Brian Bagdasarian and Robert Kavanaugh, Simply Homes emerged with a clear mission to revolutionize the provision of affordable housing solutions through the integration of cutting-edge technology. Their entrepreneurial journey was fueled by a shared commitment to addressing the critical need for accessible housing options, particularly in underserved communities. Armed with a wealth of experience in artificial intelligence and smart technology, Bagdasarian and Kavanaugh embarked on a path to disrupt the traditional real estate landscape. Recently, due to this ambitious endeavor, "Simply Homes able to raise $22m in funding. This financial boost, led by Gutter Capital and Watchung Capital, also saw contributions from Village Global, Ambush Capital, RavenOne Ventures, and several individual investors, including Neil Parikh, Gabe Flateman, and Luke Sherwin." (FinTech Global)

The infusion of capital provided by the funding round enabled Simply Homes to accelerate its development efforts, propelling the company toward its goal of democratizing smart home technology for those in need. This significant investment not only validated the potential of Simply Homes' vision but also demonstrated the market's appetite for transformative solutions in the affordable housing sector. James Gettinger, managing partner at Gutter Capital, expressed his confidence in Simply Homes' mission, emphasizing the critical importance of addressing the pressing need for affordable housing. The endorsement from investors further solidified Simply Homes' position as a trailblazer in leveraging technology to drive social impact and positive change.

As Simply Homes continues to expand its reach and impact, the company remains steadfast in its commitment to leveraging advanced technology to address societal challenges. "A portion of Simply Homes’ new funding is earmarked for developing its AI-powered tools further to better identify new properties to buy." (SOFI.COM) With the backing of influential investors and a dedicated team of innovators, Simply Homes is poised to redefine the way affordable housing is delivered and experienced. While specific details about the company's proprietary software and technology remain undisclosed to the public, the recent funding round and endorsement from industry leaders signal a promising future for Simply Homes and its ambitious mission to empower communities through accessible and sustainable housing solutions.

## Business Activities

Simply Homes recognizes the urgency of addressing the pressing issue of unused housing in low-income areas by facilitating the placement of voucher holders within these properties. This initiative not only aims to tackle the problem of vacant and run-down properties but also provides much-needed housing for individuals in need. Given that a significant portion of voucher holders lack suitable housing options, Simply Homes strategically targets this demographic to address their urgent needs. By focusing on this underserved population, the company contributes to alleviating homelessness and improving living conditions for vulnerable communities. Through its efforts, Simply Homes plays a vital role in revitalizing neglected neighborhoods and fostering inclusive urban development. By bridging the gap between available housing and those in need, the company serves as a catalyst for positive social change and economic empowerment.

Simply Homes focuses its efforts on serving Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) holders, who depend on housing assistance for accommodation. This demographic represents a significant market segment, reflecting the widespread need for accessible housing solutions. By targeting HCV holders, Simply Homes addresses the critical issue of vacant properties while simultaneously providing much-needed housing for those in need. The company's mission is to close the gap between the surplus of vacant properties and the growing demand for affordable housing options, ultimately benefiting both property owners and individuals seeking housing assistance. Simply Homes' approach not only helps alleviate housing shortages but also promotes social equity by ensuring access to safe and affordable housing for vulnerable populations. Through its innovative solutions, the company strives to create a win-win scenario where unused properties are revitalized, and individuals in need find suitable housing options.

Simply Homes distinguishes itself from competitors by its resilience against market fluctuations, especially amid challenges like rising interest rates. Unlike tech-focused institutional homebuyers, Simply Homes predicted potential obstacles ahead of time, enabling it to adjust and prosper. This proactive approach grants the company a significant advantage in the real estate sector. By recognizing potential challenges early, Simply Homes has positioned itself as a leader in navigating uncertain market conditions. Its ability to adapt and thrive sets it apart from others in the industry, ensuring long-term success. Simply Homes' foresight not only shields it from adverse effects but also strengthens its competitive position, making it a preferred choice for investors and homesellers alike. This strategic foresight underscores Simply Homes' commitment to sustainable growth and stability in a dynamic real estate landscape. Their "expansion plans include moving into more markets across the midwest in 2024, with a focus on social and economic mobility. Their development of AI-powered virtual analysts aims to further enhance their ability to identify and invest in communities and properties in need." (FinTech Global)

Simply Homes employs Recommender Systems, a type of artificial intelligence (AI) methodology that utilizes algorithms to offer personalized property recommendations to users. These systems analyze user behavior, preferences, and past interactions to suggest properties that align with their needs and interests. By leveraging Recommender Systems, Simply Homes can enhance the user experience by providing tailored suggestions, ultimately increasing the likelihood of successful matches between voucher holders and available properties. Additionally, these systems contribute to efficiency by automating the process of property selection, saving time for both users and administrators.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) represent another crucial technology utilized by Simply Homes. GIS integrates geographical data with analytical tools to visualize and interpret spatial patterns and relationships. In the context of real estate, GIS allows Simply Homes to conduct in-depth analyses of property locations, neighborhood characteristics, and market dynamics. By overlaying various data layers, such as property features, amenities, and demographic information, GIS enables the company to make informed decisions regarding site selection, market segmentation, and risk assessment. This spatial intelligence empowers Simply Homes to identify promising investment opportunities, optimize resource allocation, and mitigate potential challenges associated with property management. However, the intricacies of how Simply Homes implements GIS within its proprietary software remain undisclosed, highlighting the company's commitment to maintaining a competitive edge in the market.

In conclusion, Simply Homes is addressing the critical issue of vacant housing in low-income areas through the strategic placement of voucher holders into available properties. This initiative targets individuals in dire need of housing assistance, highlighting a substantial market opportunity for the company. Simply Homes distinguishes itself by adeptly navigating market fluctuations and leveraging advanced technologies, positioning it competitively in the real estate landscape. Despite the undisclosed specifics of its proprietary software, Simply Homes remains committed to innovation in the realm of affordable housing solutions, continuously seeking new avenues to enhance its services and make a positive impact in communities.

## Landscape

Simply Homes stands out in the real estate technology and affordable housing sectors due to its innovative approach and adaptability, especially in comparison to competitors like Free Model and FlipperForce. Over the last decade, major trends such as big data and predictive analytics have reshaped the real estate landscape. Simply Homes harnesses these trends effectively, utilizing big data and predictive analytics to analyze market trends, forecast property values, and optimize investment decisions. By leveraging these technologies, Simply Homes gains valuable insights into consumer behavior and demand patterns, allowing the company to make informed decisions and stay ahead of market fluctuations. Additionally, Simply Homes incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms into its operations, automating various processes like property valuation and customer service. This integration of cutting-edge technologies not only streamlines operations but also enhances accuracy and improves customer experiences, setting Simply Homes apart from its competitors.

In contrast, Free Model primarily offers real estate services focusing on home renovation, funding, design, and construction management. While these services are essential, Free Model's reliance on traditional models may limit its ability to adapt to evolving market trends effectively. Similarly, "FlipperForce was founded back in 2019 with a mission to streamline and organize the house flipping and rehabbing process for real estate investors." (flipperforce.com) They provide web-based house-flipping software tailored for analyzing rehab deals and estimating repair costs. However, FlipperForce's narrow focus on house flipping overlooks the broader spectrum of real estate investment opportunities addressed by Simply Homes. Moreover, FlipperForce's reliance solely on software solutions may not offer the comprehensive support and expertise that Simply Homes provides to its clients. Simply Homes' diversified approach encompasses various aspects of real estate investment, including acquisition, renovation, and management, offering clients a comprehensive solution under one roof.

Furthermore, Simply Homes' commitment to affordable housing sets it apart in the industry. "Simply isn’t just about buying and selling, Simply is about doing things a bit differently: putting people first and providing data-backed solutions that optimize value by seeing what’s possible." (SimplyHomes.Com) While other companies may focus solely on profit-driven ventures, Simply Homes prioritizes making housing accessible and affordable for a wider demographic. By addressing the pressing need for affordable housing through innovative solutions and technology integration, Simply Homes not only fulfills a social responsibility but also taps into a growing market segment. This focus on social impact resonates with modern consumers who value companies that prioritize sustainability and social responsibility. In summary, Simply Homes' innovative use of AI technology, comprehensive approach to real estate investment, and commitment to affordable housing make it a superior choice compared to competitors like Free Model and FlipperForce, positioning it as a leader in the real estate technology and affordable housing sectors.

## Results

The business impact of Simply Homes has been remarkable since its inception in 2020. It made its first foray into the real estate market by purchasing its inaugural home in January 2023. By the close of December that same year, the company had expanded its portfolio significantly, boasting a total of 108 units or homes. This rapid expansion is indicative of the company's ambitious growth trajectory and its ability to capitalize on market opportunities. Notably, since its initial launch in the first quarter, Simply Homes has consistently experienced robust revenue growth, exceeding 50% quarter over quarter. Such consistent growth underscores the company's effectiveness in generating revenue and its capacity to navigate the competitive real estate landscape.

In the real estate industry, revenue stands out as a fundamental metric for gauging success, and Simply Homes has demonstrated significant prowess in this regard. Founded in 2020, the company swiftly established itself by acquiring its first property in January 2023. By the end of the same year, Simply Homes had amassed an impressive portfolio of over 108 units. Furthermore, its revenue growth has been nothing short of exceptional, consistently surpassing the 50% mark quarter over quarter since its inception. This sustained growth trajectory underscores the company's ability to adapt to market dynamics and capitalize on emerging opportunities, positioning it as a formidable player in the real estate sector.

In contrast to Simply Homes' steady growth, Freemodel has emerged as another notable player in the real estate arena, boasting an impressive 500% revenue growth year over year. Collaborating with over 60 leading real estate brokerages, Freemodel has facilitated significant value creation for its agent partners, enabling them to secure over $33 million in additional profit for their clients. This remarkable success underscores the importance of strategic partnerships and innovative solutions in driving revenue growth and market expansion within the real estate industry. Conversely, Flipper Force's revenue, while still respectable, remains below the $5 million threshold, indicating a smaller scale of operation relative to its counterparts. However, it's essential to consider factors such as market niche and growth trajectory when evaluating the performance and potential of companies within the diverse landscape of the real estate sec

## Recommendations

Simply Homes should introduce a program aimed at empowering tenants within their affordable housing units to purchase their homes after maintaining a positive standing with the company for a designated period, let's say 'x' years. "Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies 2023 State of the Nation's Housing report found record unaffordability, extreme housing shortages and an urgent need for both public and private investment to combat these issues, as the current shortage in affordable housing is estimated to be as large as 7 million homes." (prnewswire.com) By facilitating this opportunity, Simply Homes not only fosters a stronger bond with the community but also positions itself as a catalyst for positive change within the housing market. This initiative forms a complete cycle of not only offering housing to those in need but also facilitating pathways to generational wealth and housing stability. This would greatly support the message from CEO Brian Bagdasarian statement of, "“When we buy into a neighborhood, we are investing in the community. We offer renovated homes, not just as shelter, but as a foundation for family growth and economic stability to address America’s housing crisis. Children that are able to move into lower-poverty neighborhoods can see a 31% increase in lifetime earnings. We’re making those meaningful changes, one family at a time.” (FinTech Global)

The program's success hinges on the implementation of Personalization AI, which targets specific criteria such as credit score history, criminal background, family size, and income to identify tenants who are strong candidates for homeownership. This AI-driven approach ensures that the program is both efficient and fair. Moreover, integrating this feature into Simply Homes' existing software streamlines the process, making it accessible to qualifying tenants. Additionally, proactive marketing efforts can be employed to inform eligible tenants about this opportunity, ensuring maximum participation and community engagement. Overall, this program represents a strategic move for Simply Homes to deepen its impact on the community while simultaneously empowering individuals to secure their futures through homeownership.
